desc: Cool short documentaries of creative people


--- As I try to wake up with burnt-ish coffee and a squishy sunny-side up breakfast, I am scrolling through twitter. I came across James Victore’s [retweet](https://twitter.com/like_knows_like/status/475870470320185344) about a documentary [Like Knows Like](http://likeknowslike.com/) made about him. It’s short, sweet, and inspiring for a Monday morning. Check out James’ doc below and other ones on the site!
