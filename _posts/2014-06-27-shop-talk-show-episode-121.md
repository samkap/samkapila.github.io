--- Cool Dudes, [Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000) and [Chris Coyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier) asked me to be on their show, [Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/121-sam-kapila/)! We talked about teaching Responsive Web Design, new tools like Gulp and Grunt, and I shared my opinions on some audience questions. I am so happy they asked me to be on the show; I really enjoyed it!
