Aaron Draplin, of <a href="http://www.draplin.com/2013/09/tonight_austin_1.html" target="_blank">DDC</a>, came to McGarrah Jessee to hold a Field Notes workshop and <a href="http://www.aigaaustin.org" target="blank">AIGA Austin</a> lecture about his work. Aaron is a kind and gentle soul as a teacher and speaker. He loves his family very much, and values the work he does and the people around him. And he's fucking hilarious.
Here is some evidence of a day with Draplin:<br>
