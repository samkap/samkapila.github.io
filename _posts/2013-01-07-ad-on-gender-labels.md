I found an ad that I like. The Pantene Philippines ad looks into gender labels assigned in work and social situations. I kept meaning to share it, but I had forgotten. Luckily, I was reminded when I was having dinner with my parents. I've heard many of these labels myself and try to be conscious not to use them, as well. </p>
