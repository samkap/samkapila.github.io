Four students from my summer ARTC4313H Poster Design course have work that has been shortlisted in the International competition and traveling exhibition, <a href="http://www.posterfortomorrow.org/pages/view/2012_shortlisted_poster_designers">PosterForTomorrow</a>. The students are Zachary Colquitt, Stephanie Triplett, Mark Fallis, and Kristin Sikes. On December 10th, we will find out which pieces got in (since they submitted multiple pieces). The competition had about 3000 entries, of which roughly 70 came from the students in the summer class.

I had the pleasure of submitting and having <a href="http://www.posterfortomorrow.org/en/u/1852" target="_blank">work recognized</a> by the show a few years ago when I was a grad student, and this is just such a great cause that I truly stand behind.
