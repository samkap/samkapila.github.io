I'll be honest. I started this post over the thanksgiving break and left it in draft mode. You've probably read some of these, but in case you haven't, here are some things to read and listen to as you get back into the swing of things this new year. These recs are mostly about about the future of the web and a few others that have just been of interesting to learn about (hint: foxes!).
1. [What the Screen Wants](http://frankchimero.com/what-screens-want/) by Frank Chimero
2. [The Lull](http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/thelull) by Mark Boulton
3. [Non-breaking Space Show](http://nonbreakingspace.tv/jeremy-keith/) with Jeremy Keith (one of my favorite conversations, ever)
4. [Secrets of Snow-diving Foxes](http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2014/01/03/259136596/youre-invisible-but-ill-eat-you-anyway-secrets-of-snow-diving-foxes) by NPR's Robert Krulwich
