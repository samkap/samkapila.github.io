Today, I got to stand in for the wonderful <a title="Haddie Cooke" href="http://www.twitter.com/haddiebird" target="_blank">Haddie Cooke</a> and guest-host <a href="http://www.5by5.tv" target="_blank">5by5</a>'s daily podcast, <a href="http://5by5.tv/frequency/27" target="_blank">The Frequency</a>, with 5by5's mastermind, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/danbenjamin" target="_blank">Dan Benjamin</a>. It was so much fun, and I was incredibly scared of the microphone. Dan and I talked about weird news, tech news, responsive web design, and "The Incident". <a href="http://5by5.tv/frequency/27" target="_blank">Check it out</a>. And if you'reÂ <em>still</em> not sick of hearing my voice, there's also a quick <a href="http://5by5.tv/afterdark/280" target="_blank">After Dark</a>, where we discussed food.
