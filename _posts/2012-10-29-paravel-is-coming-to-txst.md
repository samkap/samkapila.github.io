I'm so excited to announce that on November 7th, at 7pm, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/trentwalton" target="_blank">Trent Walton</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/davatron5000" target="_blank">Dave Rupert</a>, and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/raygunray" target="_blank">Reagan Ray</a> of <a href="http://www.paravelinc.com" target="_blank">Paravel Inc</a>, an Austin-based interactive shop, will be dropping by Texas State to discuss Responsive Web Design and their latest projects such as the new RWD homepage for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>. Leading the wave of mobile-friendly and Responsive Web Design, they worked on initiatives such as <a href="http://lostworldsfairs.com/" target="_blank">Lost World Type</a>, <a href="http://heroesoftexas.com/" target="_blank">Heroes of Texas</a>, <a href="http://atxwebshow.com/" target="_blank">ATX Web Show Podcasts</a>, <a href="http://www.dolectures.com" target="_blank">DoLectures</a>, and organize <a href="http://www.twitter.com/atxdribbble" target="_blank">Dribbble.com meet ups</a> for the city of Austin.

Most recently, they redesigned <a href="http://Microsoft.com/">Microsoft.com</a>. They have contributed chapters to design publications such as <a href="shop.viewportindustries.com/products/insites-the-book" target="_blank">Insites: The Book</a>, <a href="alwaysreadthemanual.com" target="_blank">The Manual</a> (book series), <a href="http://www.8faces.com" target="_blank">8Faces Magazine</a>, and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/mo-pixels-mo-problems/" target="_blank">A List Apart</a>. They created collections of <a href="http://fitvidsjs.com/" target="_blank">helpful RWD codes</a> now used by our students and industry designers as the industry standard.
