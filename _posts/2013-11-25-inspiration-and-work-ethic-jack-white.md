We spend hours or days planning what our desks or studios will look like so we feel creative in them, but Jack White touches on a mental space or mind set that helps with creativity. I particularly like the part where creativity and work ethic go hand in hand. I think work ethic allows us to explore new techniques or tools, expanding our skill set and hopefully (usually) making us more creative.
>Inspiration and work ethic... they ride next to each other.... Not everyday in your life you're going to wake up, and the clouds are gonna part and the rays from heaven are going to come down and you're going to write a song from it. Sometimes you just get in there and force yourself to work and something good will come out of it.
