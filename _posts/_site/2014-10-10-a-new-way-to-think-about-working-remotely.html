My office-mate and buddy in Greenville, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/joeytamburro">Joe</a> shared an awesome <a href="http://davidmckinney.com/blog/2013/12/29/redesigning-the-office">link about building an office into an older truck/bus</a>. It’s such a great idea, I’d love to have an office I can drive to the beach. Check out the FAQs below, too!</p>
