<p><a href="http://sassconf.com/">SassConf</a> is coming to Austin this year, and I’ve been asked to be a Call for Proposals mentor. I’ve fallen in love with Sass this past year so I’m excited to be a part of the CFP Mentoring Team and looking forward to attending it in town! If you have an idea for a talk, I encourage you to apply after learning more about <a href="http://sassconf.com/">the conference</a> and the <a href="http://sassconf.com/blog/posts/cfp-mentor-team">CFP Mentoring Team</a>.</p>
