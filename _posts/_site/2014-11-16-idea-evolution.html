<p>Just read a quote by Jason Santa Maria in his recent <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/jason-santa-maria/2014-november-15">Pastry Box Project post</a> that I thought I’d share.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because the real shape of an idea isn’t an explosion, but <strong>evolution</strong>. In order for an idea to become something valuable, it needs to be nurtured.</p>
