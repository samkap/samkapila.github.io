My favorite national soccer team, the [Koninklijke Nederlandse Voetbalbond](http://english.knvb.nl/), or KNVB, is playing against Costa Rica right now with hopes to advance to the semi-finals of the 2014 World Cup. The last World Cup was hard for me, as I watched my boys lose to Spain in the final game and had tears running down my orange-painted face in a central Texas taproom. Still, I have a lot of hope for this team that I’ve loyally supported since I was a kid. There are lots of great players this year, including [one from Curaçao](http://www.espnfc.com/player/113083/leroy-fer?season=2013), along with the classic players, van Persie, Robben, and Sneijder.
One of the best things about the team this year is that Nike worked with Wim Crouwel, the godfather of Dutch design, to create the typeface on the Dutch jerseys, says [Design Boom](http://www.designboom.com/design/nike-world-cup-fonts-07-01-2014/). One of my favorite parts is how gorgeous the 'ij' Dutch ligature is in ‘Case Crouwel’, the name of the typeface design.
