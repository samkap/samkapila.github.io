<p>We’re back at The White House to rep The Iron Yard and join in on the announcement of <a href="http://techopportunityfund.org">The Tech Opportunity Fund</a> that we are so excited and passionate about:</p>

<p>“The Iron Yard and Code Fellows, in collaboration with Operation Hope, last week launched Tech Opportunity Fund with $45 million in diversity scholarships, and goal of awarding $100 million in scholarships over five years.”</p>
