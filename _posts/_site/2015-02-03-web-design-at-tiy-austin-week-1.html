<p>The Web Design class started last week in Austin, and it was really exciting to get the class going here. We moved into our second space at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/penn+field+austin/@30.226462,-97.759832,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5fffd51e74a7c8bd?sa=X&amp;ei=ZcHQVIy4GcOqNpe8gogF&amp;ved=0CIEBEPwSMAo">Penn Field</a>, and we’re right next to Opal Divine’s, which has a great selection of draft beers AND breakfast tacos with crispy hashbrowns in them. </p>

<p>The students have learned HTML, CSS, Git, Github, file naming and folder structural rules, and all the fun and equally annoying things about floats, displays, and positioning elements on a page. They’ve enjoyed eating pizza, penned a few CodePens, introduced themselves at the <a href="http://twitter.com/atxdribbble">ATX Dribbble Meetup</a>, worked during lab with our garage door wide open, and jammed out during #IronPints with the Front End and Ruby students. They’ve even said hello to our new fish! (I’m so glad my old fish tank is being used again!) It’s been a great week, and I can’t wait to see how the rest of the 11 weeks go.</p>

<p>Here are some of those moments:</p>
