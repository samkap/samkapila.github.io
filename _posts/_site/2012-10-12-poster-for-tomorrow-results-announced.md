After waiting for months to hear results, we just found today that posters by my Summer 2012 Poster class students, Zachary Colquitt and Stephanie Triplett, were shortlisted by <a href="http://www.posterfortomorrow.org/en/gallery/competitions/gender-equality-now" target="_blank">PosterForTomorrow</a>. Their posters will exhibit in 24 countries all over the world to raise awareness for gender equality. Below is Zac's poster.
