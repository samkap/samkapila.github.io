--- This [Codepen](http://codepen.io/vaielab/pen/yoKEF/) is the most amazing use of inputs in HTML and CSS that I have ever seen! If you can hit the hidden input checkbox on the duck, it falls! This is just like when I stood directly in front of the TV and held the bright orange gun up screen as ducks flew around. Check it out:</p>
<p data-height="594" data-theme-id="6780" data-slug-hash="yoKEF" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/vaielab/pen/yoKEF/'>Duck Hunt Css</a> by Vaielab (<a href='http://codepen.io/vaielab'>@vaielab</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

Just a note: it works a lot better (read: ducks are easier to hit) when it's not embedded into a responsive layout like mine. Load up the [full CodePen](http://codepen.io/vaielab/full/yoKEF/), instead.
