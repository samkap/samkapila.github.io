SVGs, to me, feel a bit intimidating, mostly because they’re still new to me and they’re extremely powerful/practical/awesome. I found myself occasionally checking (the newly redesigned) [CanIUse](http://caniuse.com/#search=svg) for support numbers, and the green cells were another reminder that I need to push myself to get with the SVG program.
Then, this morning, I was reminded of my failures in SVG-osmosis when I saw [Chris tweeting](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/491570066366791680) some of his resources on the mystical image format. In an attempt to hold myself accountable and procrastinate just *one* last time, I thought I’d share the plethora of links I’ve been hoarding for months on end.
* Daniel Mall’s [_SVG Workflow for Designers_](http://danielmall.com/articles/svg-workflow-for-designers/): (I’ve been hoarding this one for over a year now!)
* CSS-Tricks’ [_Cagematch: Inline SVG vs Icon Fonts_](http://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/) : Learned quite a bit from this on SVGs and type.
* CSS-Tricks’ [_SVG Fallbacks_](http://css-tricks.com/svg-fallbacks/): Because let’s consider the big picture and move towards a more responsible web.
* Creative Droplet’s [_Export SVG for the Web with Illustrator CC_](http://creativedroplets.com/export-svg-for-the-web-with-illustrator-cc/): For the CC crowd.
* Slides from Todd Parker’s Artifact Austin [_Leaving Pixels Behind: A Vector Workflow for Designers_](http://filamentgroup.com/lab/artifact-austin-svg-workflow.html) talk : A great talk that I saw earlier this year.
* [SnapSVG](http://snapsvg.io/): SVGs made easy with Javascript.
* Searching for [SVGs on CodePen](http://codepen.io/search/?q=svg&limit=all&order=&depth=everything&show_forks=false&page=2) : The best way to learn is dissect and tinker.
* CSS-Tricks’ mega-list called [_A Compendium of SVG Information_](http://css-tricks.com/mega-list-svg-information/) : The big Kahuna of SVG info.
* Smashing Magazine’s [Rethinking responsive SVGs](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/05/rethinking-responsive-svg/) : Keepin’ things responsive. This could lead to fun stuff.
So, here’s to learning more about SVGs!
**Update (11am CST)**: My friend, Jason Weaver, shared a few more awesome links with me:
* This awesome [Kickstarter campaign for a Pocket Guide for Writing SVGS](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1207904509/pocket-guide-to-writing-svg)
* [SVGjs](http://www.svgjs.com/) Lightweight SVG party!
