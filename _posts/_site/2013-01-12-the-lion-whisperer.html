<p>My friend, Emma, shared this amazing video of Kevin Richarson, the “Lion Whisperer”, as he wears a GoPro Hero3+ and interacts with lions and hyenas that he has raised on a African reserve since they were little. The message is one we easily fail to remember. His relationship with these animals is awe-inspiring. I hugged my cats really tightly after.&lt;/p&gt;
