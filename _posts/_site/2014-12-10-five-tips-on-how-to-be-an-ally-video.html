<p>Blogger <a href="https://twitter.com/chescaleigh">Franchesca Ramsey</a> shares the perfect tips on how to be an ally. Ramsey defines an ally by “a person who wants to fight for the equality of a marginalized group that they’re not a part of”.  Given recent events—and given our history—I think its important to <strong>actively listen</strong> and try to understand what people are going through, and then be an advocate for change. Further, on the direct <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dg86g-QlM0#action=share">Youtube page</a>, Ramsey shares more resources for allies of all kinds: gender and sexual orientation allies, allies for race equality, and a whole lot more. It’s great advice and worth watching, reflecting upon, and sharing. This advice will help us get there.</p>
