<p>The band Pomplamoose just released a creative, single shot music video in which they mash-up Pharell’s “Happy” and “Get Lucky”. As the video explains, they use a lot of white foam boards, a projector, and a simple video editor to make the whole video. It’s just a smooth version of the two songs, and the video shows just how much care and out-of-the-box thinking Pomplamoose puts into their work. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;</p>
