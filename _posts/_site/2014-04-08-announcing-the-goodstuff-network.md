--- It's here, it's here! The [GoodStuff Network](http://goodstuff.fm/) is officially launching today! The network is run by [Chris Enns](https://twitter.com/iChris), [Tim Smith](https://twitter.com/ttimsmith), and [Adam Clark](https://twitter.com/avclark). One of the shows I co-host—[the Non-Breaking Web Show](http://goodstuff.fm/nbsp) (with Chris Enns and [Chris Schmitt](http://www.twitter.com/teleject))—moved over to the network, and I joined a new daily show called [Transmission](http://goodstuff.fm/transmission) as a design correspondent (on Wednesdays). NBSP should get back to it's regular schedule soon, but we have our last 2013 episodes with [Dave Rupert](http://goodstuff.fm/nbsp/45), [Jen Simmons](http://goodstuff.fm/nbsp/46) and [Steve Fisher](http://goodstuff.fm/nbsp/47) posted. 

The network will be LIVE all day so [tune in](http://goodstuff.fm/live) for free giveaways and network chatter starting at 9am CDT!
