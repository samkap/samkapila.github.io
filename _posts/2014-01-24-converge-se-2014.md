Last October, I had the opportunity to attend [ConvergeFL](http://www.convergefl.com) in Jacksonville, Florida. The whole experience was great and the speakers, who ranged from web designers, app designer, musicians, and others, taught me a lot. It was nice to be at a conference that was a good size, where people really got to know each other. I even got to catch up with friends from college and eat some of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I’ve ever had from a food truck outside a craft brewery (more on that in my [ConvergeFL post](http://www.samkapila.com/thoughts/converge-fl-2013)).
Now, I’m excited to announce that this year, I will be one of the keynote speakers at [ConvergeSE](http://convergese.com/) in Columbia, South Carolina! I will be a keynote speaker early Saturday morning and I will talk about the state of web education. If you would like to attend, you can [register](https://account.unmatchedstyle.com/register/convergese-2014/) for the 3 day conference and workshops (May 1st to 3rd) or find out more about the [programming](http://convergese.com/speakers.php). Hope to see you there!
