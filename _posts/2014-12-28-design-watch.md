[Design.watch](http://designers.watch/) is a lovely list of inspiring documentaries for designers and artists that my friend [Greg](http://twitter.com/brilliantcrank) shared today. I shared my favorite three, that I found the most thought-provoking and must-sees for designers and design students.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The top three must-see from a critical thinking standpoint:
1) Urbanized
2) Inform and Delight
3) Teaching to see</p>— Sam Kapila (@samkap) <a href="https://twitter.com/samkap/status/549417556088729600">December 29, 2014</a></blockquote>

Turns out, the last one is available to see online for free! Check it out below:
> Design is always visualizing an idea. It’s definitely about drawing attention. its about informing. It’s about distance reading. It’s also about symbolizing something… because like poetry you have to get the essences of something.
