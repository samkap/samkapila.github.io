I am beyond excited to announce that I'm joining the ATX Web Show AND Non-breaking Space Show as a co-host. I'll be joining Dave Rupert, Travis Swicegood, and Andy Keil on a regular basis to discuss Austin's web news, developments, etc. on the ATX Web Show. I'll be joining Christopher Schmitt and Chris Enns to interview web folks on NBSP! First hosting gigs on each show:

* [ATX Web Show â€” #65](http://atxwebshow.com/2013/06/18/episode-65-hackathon-catchupisode/)
* [NBSP interviews Rachel Nabors](http://nonbreakingspace.tv/rachel-nabors/)
