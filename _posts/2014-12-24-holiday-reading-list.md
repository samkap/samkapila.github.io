I just returned to Austin, TX after three months of working in Greenville, South Carolina at my awesome job at [The Iron Yard](http://www.theironyard.com) as a Web Design Instructor (more on this later!). During my brief time in SC, I’ve read in the green, green grass next to gushing waterfalls and pleasant rivers, gone on conference talk and day long vacation trips to Austin, the border where the Carolinas meet, Charleston and Columbia, SC, Louisville, KY, Memphis, TN, Atlanta, GA,  Jacksonville, FL, and New Orleans, LA. I’ve seen parts of the country I’ve never seen before and been in airports I *actually* wish I had more time in (I’m looking at you, Detroit Metro). And in this time on (airport terminal) trains, planes, and automobiles, I read and listened to quite a few awesome books. I’ve knocked out 2.5 books in the last 5 days and they’ve all been amazing.

In April, I wrote that [I wanted to read more and shared a list of books](http://samkapila.com/journal/read-more) that were recommended to me. This year, I’m glad to say that I’ve travelled more than ever, and hence, have read more than ever. I do spent a lot of time in my car, and it’s a lot easy to drive with a book to listen to. Both of these things make me extremely happy. Here’s what I’ve been reading since in case you're looking for some holiday reading:

### Since April, I read
* [_The Power of Habit_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/B007EJSMC8/ref=tmm_aud_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1397665407&sr=8-1), this was on my last list.
* [_Let’s Pretend This Never Happened_](http://www.amazon.com/Pretend-Never-Happened-Mostly-Memoir/dp/B007UWP66O/ref=sr_1_1_title_2_audd?ie=UTF8&qid=1397665846&sr=8-1&keywords=let%27s+pretend+this+never+happened), also on the last list, good for a road trip. 
* [_Paddle Your Own Canoe_](http://www.amazon.com/Paddle-Your-Own-Canoe-Fundamentals/dp/B00FFHINZM), Everything I expected from Offerman, yet also a lot more...some of which was unexpected and weird.
* [_Yes, Please_](http://www.amazon.com/Yes-Please/dp/B00MP22QRQ/ref=sr_1_1_twi_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419432664&sr=1-1&keywords=yes+please), keeping the _Parks & Rec_ thing going. This one more light and funny, and AP was vulnerable, honest, and goofy as she shared stories of _SNL_, her divorce, and what feminism really is.
* [_The Leadership Playbook_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Leadership-Playbook/dp/B00LOOURLI/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419432769&sr=1-1&keywords=the+leadership+playbook) Leadership as coaching, not managing. A great book that’s opening my mind up to how organizations can/should work.
* [_#GirlBoss_](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_p_n_feature_browse-b_mrr_0?fst=as%3Aoff&rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Aboss+girl%2Cp_n_feature_browse-bin%3A1240885011&keywords=boss+girl&ie=UTF8&qid=1419432987&rnid=618072011) This audiobook is amazing and I’m not even done with it. It’s a lot more practical advice than most bio books provide and it’s surprisely empowering.  This is on par with Kelly Cutrone’s [_If you're going to cry, go outside_](http://www.amazon.com/If-You-Have-Cry-Outside-ebook/dp/B0034EJL54/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419433036&sr=1-3&keywords=kelly+cutrone)
* [_Manage Your Day to Day_](http://www.amazon.com/Manage-Your-Day---Day-Creative-ebook/dp/B00B77UE4W/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419433310&sr=1-1&keywords=manage+your+day+to+day), the title says it all.
* [_Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey_](http://www.amazon.com/Kentucky-Bourbon-Whiskey-American-Heritage/dp/B00DMF7O90/ref=tmm_aud_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1419433367&sr=1-1), a brief history of bourbon before my Kentucky trip. Under $5, too.
* [_I’d Like to Apologize to Every Teacher I Ever Had_](http://www.amazon.com/Like-Apologize-Every-Teacher-Ever/dp/B0098TUPSQ/ref=tmm_aud_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1419433465&sr=1-1), Who’s the boss at telling great anecdotes? Tony Danza, that’s who.
* [_Wild_](http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Found-Pacific-Crest-Oprahs/dp/B007MIWUG0/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=&qid=), one of my favorite reads from our Ladies in Tech Book Club.

 
### Next on my list
* [_Focus, A Simplicity Manifesto in the Age of Distraction_](http://www.amazon.com/Focus-Simplicity-Manifesto-Age-Distraction/dp/B005UJSL2A/ref=tmm_aud_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1419433574&sr=1-1)
* [_The Kinfolk Table_](http://www.amazon.com/Kinfolk-Table-Nathan-Williams/dp/1579655327/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1419433694&sr=1-1&keywords=kinfolk+table), a lovely gift from my dear South Carolina friend, Andrew.
* [_Teaching Critical Thinking_](http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Critical-Thinking-Practical-Wisdom/dp/0415968208/ref=lh_ni_t?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER), can't wait to get into this one.
* [_Make it Stick_](http://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/B00M1Z2THY/ref=sr_1_1_twi_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1419434035&sr=8-1&keywords=make+it+stick), a book on teaching recommended by my awesome colleague, Jake. 


Hope you get some time to pour a drink, cozy up by the fireplace, and crack open or plug into a great book this holiday. If you're reading something currently, share it below.
