I wrote an article for .net Magazine about 5 lessons learned in a Responsive Web Design classroom, that go beyond technical processes in RWD. This was my first published article and it was fun to write. <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/5-lessons-responsive-web-design-classroom" target="_blank">Check it out</a>!
